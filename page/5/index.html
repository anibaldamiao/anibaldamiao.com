Clarke in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Three Laws</a>). Think about it: all new technologies always feel somehow amazing and magic.</p><p>I never liked chemistry in school though. I now blame the teacher and the curriculum and/or the lack of curiosity instilled in students.</p><p> </p><p>Here's a more fun perspective that doesn't care about math, chemical groups, periods or atomic weights.</p><p>When i was a teenager, no one told me that hydrogen and helium (and nothing else) were created in the first moments after the big bang. And no one told me that every other element that naturally or un-naturally occurs in nature are created those 2 elements put through a lot of energy. A LOT! </p><p>It doesn't make a lot of sense that iron, lithium, gold, uranium or whatever else comes from hidrogen and helium.</p><p>Super novae, cosmic rays, small stars and large stars are basically factories in an expanding universe where absurds amounts of energy and collisions create and spew elements across the universe. This stuff slowly forms into planets that we later living in.</p><p>Nucleogenic reactions are fascinating because they are the force behind this magic.</p><p>Carbon, for instance is the 4th element most abundant in the universe and it came from the 2 most abundant ones (Helium, Hidrogen) and a lots of energy creates carbon.  And because carbon is more abundant than eg zinc, we know that zinc is less abundant in the universe and we know that zinc was formed later. Some elements are so complex that they need even more extreme forces to happen and those are even more rare.</p><p>More, 90 elements are found in nature. But humans are able to create 22 others by controlling big amounts of energy. A good example is plutonium that is created from uranium.</p><p>Now why is chemistry more interesting than H+H+O = water?</p><p>Because the 2030's and 2040's may be a defining moment for humankind. This week was an eventful week with multiple news of advancements that show that fusion is getting closer. And with the fusion, come immense energy. </p><p>Once we control fusion, we will stop worrying about radiation from nuclear/fission.</p><p>Can anything be more exciting than that? Yes.</p><p>Because free energy can create every single element in the periodic table from water and air.</p><p>We wouldn't have to exploit earth anymore or emit CO2 because we'd control a process that creates anything that we need (lithium, iron, zinc, gold...).</p><p>How mindblowing is that?</p><p>Anything that we need are built from basic chemical elements that we see in the periodic table. So..</p><p>A burger is just energy + water + air.</p><p>A plane is just energy + water + air.</p><p>Gold is just energy + water + air.</p><p>Everything becomes incredibly cheap since it's abundant. We stop fighting for water, oil or riches and instead focus on our dreams.</p><p>A world unbound by anything than dreams..</p><p>Just like magic.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/damiansen" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://anibaldamiao.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/anibal.damiao" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://anibaldamiao.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjnOEsrin1Or3pFxc6U_YOg" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://anibaldamiao.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p><strong>Powered by Publii</strong></p><p>Publii is a great CMS that I personally recommend as an alternative to wordpress and other paid options.
